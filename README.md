This project is related to banking & finance sector and the dataset has been taken from Kaggle.com. 
It contains details of a bank's customers and whether the customer has left the bank (closed his account) or he/she continues to be a customer.
The task was to identify which factors contribute to customer churn and build a machine learning model to predict which customers are more likely to leave the bank.
Iâ€™ve performed EDA, Visualization & Feature Engineering on the data, used SVC for the classification task and obtained 80% cross validation accuracy with 0.85 ROC AUC score.
