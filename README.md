# Customer Churn Prediction

Problem Statement: The project was related to banking sector. A
bank had details of their customers and whether the customer
has left the bank (closed his account) or not. The task was to
identify which factors contribute towards customer churn and
build a machine learning model to predict which customers are
more likely to leave the bank.

Solution: Iâ€™ve performed EDA, Data Cleaning & Visualization on
the dataset, used Support Vector Classifier for binary
classification and obtained 80% cross validation accuracy with
0.85 ROC AUC score.
